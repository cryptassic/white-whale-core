In Ethereum for example, an `Addr` would contain a user visible address like 0x14d3cc818735723ab86eaf9502376e847a64ddad and the corresponding `CanonicalAddr` would store the 20 bytes 0x14, 0xD3, ..., 0xAD. In Cosmos, the bech32 format is used for `Addr`s and the `CanonicalAddr` holds the encoded bech32 data without the checksum. Typical sizes are 20 bytes for externally owned addresses and 32 bytes for module addresses (such as x/wasm contract addresses). That being said, a chain might decide to use any size other than 20 or 32 bytes.\n\nThe safe way to obtain a valid `CanonicalAddr` is using `Api::addr_canonicalize`. In addition to that there are many unsafe ways to convert any binary data into an instance. So the type shoud be treated as a marker to express the intended data type, not as a validity guarantee of any sort.",
