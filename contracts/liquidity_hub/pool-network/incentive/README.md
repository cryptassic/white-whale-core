# Incentives

Migaloo's incentive contract is used to create incentive flows associated with LP tokens. Incentive contracts allow any user to incentivize a pair created. External users can then create positions to utilize the flow by bonding their LP tokens. Users will receive rewards for _each active flow_.

To find out more about the incentives contracts, refer to the [Migaloo docs](https://ww0-1.gitbook.io/migaloo-docs/liquidity-hub/overview-1/).
